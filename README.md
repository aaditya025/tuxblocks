TuxBlocks
=========

TuxBlocks is a cross-platform aglebra game, originally created for [Tux4Kids](http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/) during Google's Summer of code 2013. The game is built on top of the [PlayN](code.google.com/p/playn/) game engine. The game is currently in an open Beta, with full release pending.


Concept
-------
TuxBlocks aims to be both a fun math game and a virtual manipulative which can help students visualize algebra problems in a new and useful way. The game plays like a tradition tower defense style game, with players building mazes out of a variety of towers, each with their own special ability, to prevent enemies from crossing from one side of a grid to the other. However, in TuxBlocks, the way the player aquires new towers is by solving alebra problems. Instead of simply asking the player for the solution the equation, forcing them to do a little math as the price for the game content, TuxBlocks integrates the solving process into the gameplay. The equation is represented by movable blocks, which the player can pick up, move around, simplify and modify to help solve equation. The game rewards successful solving, not only with towers for the gameplay, but also with levels up, which allow players to skip easier arithmetic. TuxBlocks has a variety of difficulty levels, both for the gameplay and the mathematics, allowing students of many acheivement levels to enjoy the game. TuxBlocks also features a "Build" mode which allows players to construct their own problems, perhaps even homework problems, and use the solve mechanics in the game to help solve it.


Platforms
---------

TuxBlocks has working versions on the following platforms:
 * Android 2.3+
 * [HTML5](http://tux-blocks.appspot.com/) (using both Canvas and WebGL)
 
An iOS version is currently being co-developed with the [PlayN-IOS](https://github.com/thomaswp/playn-ios) library, which will allow an iOS release without the use of the proprietary Xamarin Studio.
