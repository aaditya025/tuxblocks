Suggestions from beta:
-have a button to flip the sign of the selected number on the number select screen
-more flexible tutorial (less dependency on player following directions)
-stronger checks to prevent really high numbers in problems (specifically composites)
-when a problem is solved, just exit the solve screen?
-different font or text color for operators in modifier blocks (distinguish times and x)
-"advanced" mode (without graphical solver)
-solving groups of modifiers at once
-highlight repeat/cancel buttons in tutorial when mentioned
-add an existing maze to the tutorial level to demostrate mazing
-ability to change tower placement immediately afterwards, to mitigate errors
-faster/weaker enemies to speed things up
-3(x) -> 3x
-rethink tower and block art, make it more interesting
