Suggestions from beta:
-have a button to flip the sign of the selected number on the number select screen
-more flexible tutorial (less dependency on player following directions)
-stronger checks to prevent really high numbers in problems (specifically composites)
-when a problem is solved, just exit the solve screen?
-different font or text color for operators in modifier blocks (distinguish times and x)
-"advanced" mode (without graphical solver)

Bugs
-text cut off on Android
-flashing blocks on Android
-more graphical bugs on older android devices
-unsolvable problems (unconfirmed)

For the future:
-multiple grids
-color/grid/#levels selection
-high scores
-shuffle equations
