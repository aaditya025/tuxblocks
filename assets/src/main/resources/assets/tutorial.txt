Welcome to TuxBlocks – the game with all the right angles! This is the main menu, where you can choose to Play Mode or Build Mode. Let’s start off by pressing the Play button.

This screen lets you choose the difficulty for you game. The settings will make more sense once you’ve played some, so let’s move on. The buttons at the top let you go back or start the game. Let’s start the game.

This is the Grid. Blocks appear and try to get across, and it’s your job to stop them.

You do that by placing towers on the grid. Towers will shoot at the blocks to destroy them. You can make a maze out of towers to slow the blocks down.

There are different types of towers. Pea shooters are weak but good for mazing. The B.I.G. Shooter fires a missile which hits groups of blocks. Freezers slow down blocks. Zappers shoot lightening, which jumps from block to block. Try dragging a Tower onto the Grid.

Great! Now, if a block gets through your maze, you lose a life. If you lose all your lives, it’s game over. Blocks will come in “Rounds,” with a break in between. The menu at the top of the screen show your lives and how long until the next round.

It also shows how many upgrades you have. You get upgrades by earning points, and you earn points by destroying blocks or doing math. You can use upgrades to make Towers stronger.

To make it easier to click on a Tower, you can double-click the Grid to zoom in. Try it.

Now click on a Tower to select it. If you’re still having trouble, you can hold your mouse down on the Grid to bring up a circle. Drag it over to a Tower to select it.

Now upgrade the Tower by pressing the Upgrade button. You can also sell Towers by clicking the Sell button, and the pressing it again to confirm. This will destroy your tower and give you some extra points.

Now you can double-click to zoom back out.

Place a few more Towers and you’ll be ready for your first Round. You can trigger the round early by hitting the Go button!

You survived your first Round, but we’re going to need more Towers for the next one. You get more Towers by pressing the MORE TOWERS button.

Each button here shows you a problem you can solve, and the reward you’ll get for solving it. Try clicking on one.
